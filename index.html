                Dear Ms. Concepcion, <br><br>
            I have carried this inside of me for what feels like an eternity. How am I to put it? I don‚Äôt even know. But I just can‚Äôt keep this inside anymore. I have to tell you what‚Äôs been going on in my mind and my heart for what feels like an eternity now, and hopefully you will understand why I kept quiet for so long. <br><br>
It was during online classes in Grade 7 that it all started. It was such a bizarre time for everyone, and honestly, I wasn‚Äôt expecting anything out of it. But then we ended up being grouped together for a project. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at first, but the more we interacted, I started noticing things about you. It wasn‚Äôt just your smile‚Äîbut that really did make me smile, too‚Äîit was everything. I always think about your kindness, your patience, and the way you treated people when things get hectic. You were just one of those people who exuded this cool, friendly energy about you, and that‚Äôs just how it drew me to you. There was something that just kind of clicked inside me, even though I had no idea what It was at the time. <br><br> I mean, there was just something about you that initially drew my attention in a way that nobody else had before‚Äîand once I was able to think about you, I just couldn‚Äôt stop doing so afterward. I was too shy to speak out then. We were classmates, and I wasn‚Äôt very open regarding what I felt I had for this person because I didn‚Äôt think it would come off anyway. Maybe the feelings would just pass with the passing of time; they wouldn‚Äôt. <br><br>
Then came Grade 8, and I truly believed my world crashed when we were no longer classmates. It felt like something was missing. We hardly ever got to talk, and I kept thinking we must have been in the same class again. It‚Äôs kind of embarrassing, but during recess, I‚Äôd walk by your classroom just to catch a glimpse of you. I wasn‚Äôt brave enough to say anything then, but just seeing you for a moment brightened up my day. It is really silly, but those short minutes gave me little moments of happiness. You did not know it then, but even at that time, you could brighten up my day just by being yourself. <br><br>
I was excited when I knew we were going to be classmates again in Grade 9. I thought, ‚ÄúThis is it. This is my chance.‚Äù But when the time came, I chickened out. I guess I was just too afraid of what would happen if I told you. I feared messing up our friendship and how you would react. I kept things inside me instead of saying anything because I buried myself in schoolwork, hoping you would notice me in any other way. In fact, you were my motivation to do everything. Whenever I wanted to give up, I‚Äôd think of you, and that is what gave me the urge to work harder. <br><br>
Now we are in Grade 10. All these years went by and I did not say anything. But I just cannot stay silent anymore. You had been such a huge part of my life, even when you didn‚Äôt know it. You‚Äôve been the one thing that‚Äôs kept me going, and I need to tell you the truth‚ÄîI‚Äôve been in love with you since Grade 7. It's not that I just like you though. <br><br> Over time, I‚Äôve just learned to love everything about you, even things you may not see in yourself. <br><br> It's little things, not merely your smile or how kind you are to everyone. It‚Äôs little things that make you, you. I love your imperfections, your flaws, and even those moments when you feel you are not your best. To me, those are the moments that make you real, that make you more beautiful than anything else. I love the way you carry yourself; it is like the very energy that lights a room. I do not know; it‚Äôs not something everyone saw in you, but to me and probably many others, that‚Äôs what made you so beautiful. <br><br> I see how you try your best strength even when things get tough. I see how you are kind towards people even though they do not deserve it. You have that power within you that I admire so much, even when things are just not going right in your life. I never found fear in front of everyone else to be you. What I like about you is not that you should find happiness and it‚Äôs going as fine as you wanted it to. I love you not only when everything is okay, when you are having a bad day when you‚Äôre uncertain about who you are. <br><br> I love everything about you‚Äîthe way you smile, the way you face up to life‚Äôs downsides. You have just that particular vibe, that energy, which makes anything you touch sublime, everything sublimely better. And it is not like something you turn on when things are all right‚Äîit is just who you are. You are my inspiration throughout all of junior high. Every time I needed a boost for myself, I thought of you. It is because of you that I have been able to push myself to perform better. Also, it is because of you that I have given myself the reason to continue at times when I wanted to quit. It is you who inspire me to become the best version of myself, though we haven‚Äôt discussed this much. No matter what happens next, I‚Äôm glad that I finally told you. <br><br> You are the cause of everything that I‚Äôve done, and I just want you to know that you‚Äôre truly special to me, in every way possible.

                With all my heart, <br> Mr. Espino
